- <b>Navigating to a directory and list subdirectories</b>
- <b>Displaying the contents of a file</b> 
- <b>Displaying the first 10 lines of a file</b>



<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Qwiklabs</b> 

<h2>Lab walk-through:</h2>

 <h2>Task 1: Get the current directory information</h2>
In this task, I used the commands I learned  to check the current working directory and list its contents.
 <br /> <br />
(1) First, I used the command "pwd" to check the current working directory. <br/> <br/>
(2) Finally, I used the command "ls" to display the names of the files and directories in the current working directory.

  <h2>Task 2: Change directory and list the subdirectories </h2>
In this task, I navigated to a new directory and determined the subdirectories it contained.
 <br /> <br />
(1) First, I used the command "cd reports" to navigate to the reports directory. <br/> <br/>
(2) Finally, I used the command "ls" to display the names of the files and directories in the reports directory.

  <h2>Task 3: Locate and read the contents of a file </h2>
In this task, I navigated to a subdirectory and read the contents of a file it contained.
<br /> <br />
(1) First, I used the command "cd users" to navigate to the users directory. <br/> <br/>
(2) Next, I used the command "ls" to display the names of the files and directories in the users directory. <br/> <br/>
(3) Finally, I used the command "cat" to print the contents of the file to the shell.

  <h2>Task 4: Navigate to a directory and locate a file </h2>
In this task, I navigated to a new directory, located a file, and examined the contents of the file.
 <br /> <br />
(1) First, I used the command "cd logs" to navigate to the logs directory. <br/> <br/>
(2) Next, I used the command "ls" to display the names of the files and directories in the logs directory. <br/> <br/>
(3) Finally, I used the command "head" to display just the beginning of a file, by default ten lines.
